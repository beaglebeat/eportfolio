---

I'm an electrical and computer engineering student at MassBay Community College in Wellesley.

I previously studied music at Berklee College of Music in Boston, MA. I spent a decade working as a musician, audio engineer, and occasional freelance software developer. I've always had a strong connection to computers and technology, but in the past few years, I discovered a passion for building hardware in particular. I created this website to share my projects.

## My Experience

Coding languages: HTML, CSS, JS, Python, C++

Visual software: Photoshop, Solidworks

Audio software: Ableton Live, Logic Pro

Game engines: Unity, Godot

## What am I looking for?

At the moment, I'm seeking roles where I can combine my skills as a creative problem solver. I have direct experience in leadership roles and enjoy working with teams small or large.
