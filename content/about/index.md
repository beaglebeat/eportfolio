## Who am I?

I'm an electrical and computer engineering student currently based in Worcester, MA.

I previously studied music at Berklee College of Music in Boston, MA. After leaving Berklee, I spent a decade working as a musician, audio engineer, and freelance artist. Throughout these endeavors, I've always harbored a strong connection with technology. I've grown particularly passionate about designing and building computer hardware. To meet these ends, I recently received an Associate of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering degree from MassBay Community College in Wellesley, MA with highest honors. I'm now enrolled in Worcester Polytechnic Institute to pursue my B.S. and M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering.

## My Experience

Coding languages:
- Python, C, C++, Verilog

Visual software:
- Photoshop, SolidWorks, SquareLine

Audio software:
- Ableton Live, Logic Pro

Game engines:
- Unity, Godot

Gardening:
- Cucumbers, Watermelon, Tomatoes

## What am I looking for?

At the moment, I'm seeking roles where I can combine my skills as a creative problem solver. These are more than empty platitudes -- I live to pick apart systems. I have a strong foundation in a wide variety of programming languages from time spent in web development, video game development, and especially microcontroller programming. I also have direct experience in leadership roles and enjoy working with teams of all sizes.
