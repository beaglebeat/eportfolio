This is an in-progress project and part of a series. I'm currently learning to build basic basic electronic circuits with digital components. These projects are pushing my knowledge to its limits. First up is a timer-controlled electronic kick drum based around a bridged-T network.

## The design

This is where I'm going to discuss my approach.

## Tables

These numbers don't mean anything, but this is where I'm going to discuss the different components I chose.

   R1 | R2 | C1,C2 | Freq | Q
